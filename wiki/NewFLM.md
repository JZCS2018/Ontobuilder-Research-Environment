## Creating a new FLM: ##

•	Make sure you have the source code for Ontobuilder. If you don’t go to: 
[https://bitbucket.org/tomers77/ontobuilderdev.](https://bitbucket.org/tomers77/ontobuilderdev.)

•	see TermOrder for an example of FLM.

There are 2 main ways to create a new First Line Matcher:

[a.	Writing an algorithm and add it to Ontobuilder ](a.	Writing an algorithm and add it to Ontobuilder )

[b.	Writing an algorithm directly in ORE ](b.	Writing an algorithm directly in ORE )

* After creating a new Flm it is highly recommend to use [Ontology Invariance Experiment](https://bitbucket.org/tomers77/ontobuilder-research-environment/wiki/OntologyInvariance) to test it.
