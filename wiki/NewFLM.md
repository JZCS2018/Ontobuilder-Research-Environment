## Creating a new FLM: ##

•	Make sure you have the source code for Ontobuilder. If you don’t go to: 
[https://bitbucket.org/tomers77/ontobuilderdev.](https://bitbucket.org/tomers77/ontobuilderdev.)

•	see TermOrder for an example of FLM.

There are 2 main ways to create a new First Line Matcher:

[a.	Writing an algorithm and add it to Ontobuilder](https://github.com/shraga89/Ontobuilder-Research-Environment/blob/master/wiki/a.%20Writing%20an%20algorithm%20and%20add%20it%20to%20Ontobuilder.md)

[b.	Writing an algorithm directly in ORE ](https://github.com/shraga89/Ontobuilder-Research-Environment/blob/master/wiki/b.%20%20%20Writing%20an%20algorithm%20directly%20in%20ORE.md)

* After creating a new Flm it is highly recommend to use [Ontology Invariance Experiment](https://github.com/shraga89/Ontobuilder-Research-Environment/blob/master/wiki/OntologyInvariance.md) to test it.
