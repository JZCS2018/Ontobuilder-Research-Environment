== Experiment Set-Up ==
We assess the impact of using NBprecision and NBrecall instead of regular precision and recall for the assessment of 1LMs. Our practical setting is the following: We are attempting to tune the OntoBuilder first line matcher called Term. Term calculates string similarity between schema attributes. Each score is actually composed of 2 scores: one score is calculated on the attribute name (name score) and another is calculated on the attribute label (label score). The weight of each score is a tunable parameter. Previous approaches such as [Lee2007] have used machine learning on test datasets to learn the optimal values for such parameters. These learning efforts required the matcher to return a binary similarity matrix. To achieve this, some rounding or selection rule should be applied. In our case, we use two OntoBuilder 2nd line matchers SM and Threshold to perform the match selection.
