# Has golden mapping? (True / False)\\ A dataset which has a golden mapping has a list of correspondences deemed, correct by some user to which match results can be compared. All schema pairs with golden mapping can be found at the table "schemapairs" of the schemamatching database.
# Has instances? (True / False) \\ False = schemas only, True = schemas + schema instances
# Supports DB lookup? (True / False)\\ Match results are saved in a database and can subsequently be efficiently retrieved  instead of performing the match over and over for each experiment. For usage example see simpleMatch experiment.

|1| OBWebForms|DTD defined XML| True | True | False |[[https://bitbucket.org/tomers77/ontobuilder/wiki/Home|press here]]| Web-form is a collection of 249 ontologies, automatically extracted from Web forms using the OntoBuilder Extractor and matched into 151 pairs. For each pair, an exact match was defined manually. The ontologies are small, with 10-30 attributes each. An overwhelming majority of the correspondences are 1 : 1.| 247| 151||
