## Ontology Invariance Experiment ##

This Experiment is Intended especially for creating new First/Second line matchers.

The Experiment works on both FLM and SLM, runs them on Experiment Schema Pair and makes sure the associated ontologies have remained the same as before.

*All the current FLM to date (14.6.2014) have been checked with this experiment and passed perfectly.
