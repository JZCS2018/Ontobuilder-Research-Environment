== Simple Match Experiment ==
In this experiment the supplied schema pair is matched using all 1LM and 2LM supplied. For each 1LM - 2LM combination precision and recall are calculated on the result vs. the exact match. 

A **detailed version** of Simple Match also exist. for more information, please click [[https://bitbucket.org/tomers77/ontobuilder-research-environment/wiki/Detailed%20Simple%20Match|here]].
