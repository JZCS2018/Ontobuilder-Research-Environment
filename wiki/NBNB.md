## NBNB Evaluation Experiment ##

Evaluates all first line matchers supplied against multiple human responses for schema pairs supplied.

Assumes the schemapair folder contains a folder named humans.

The folder should contain a set of files, each representing the opinion of a single human judge on a single schema pair.

File suffix should match the schemapair file name. (e.g. Excel2CRM.mapping matches J1Excel2CRM.mapping, J2Excel2CRM.mapping, etc.)
